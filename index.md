# Blaise Watson

Hello! This is my (Blaise Watson's) site where where I post projects and sporadically blog. It's the best place to keep up to date on me and things I'm working on.

## Work

I'm looking for work! Reach out at dblaisewatson@gmail.com

## Software

Here's my github: https://github.com/ch33zer

Here's a selection of software projects you may find interesting:

* [You Autocomplete Me](https://autocomplete-guess.blaise.gg/) [Github](https://github.com/ch33zer/autocomplete_guess) - A fun little web game. Put in a query, then guess the autocompletes for that query.
* [Japanese -> English Translator](https://github.com/ch33zer/translation) - A barely functional Japanese to English translator. Built to understand the transformer architecture and [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).
* [Fourier Playground](https://blaise.gg/fourier_playground/fourier.html) [Github](https://github.com/ch33zer/fourier_playground) - Fourier transform playground: take the Fourier transform of functions or SVGs and plot them.
* [Zoom](https://blaise.gg/zoom/index.html) [Github](https://github.com/ch33zer/zoom) - Create a zoomable fractal character string. Try passing the `?chars=<string>` URL parameter, like [this](https://blaise.gg/zoom/index.html?chars=金魚)
* [Shapes](https://blaise.gg/shapes/index.html) [Github](https://github.com/ch33zer/shapes) - Animation of a neat shape. Absolutely pointless, except that I really like it :D
* [Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/ch33zer/aoc2023) - Archive of my solutions to Advent of Code for 2023	
* [Self deleting](self-deleting-production.self-deletion.workers.dev) (GitHub)[https://github.com/ch33zer/self-deleting] - Every time anyone accesses the page a random character is deleted.

## Biking

I love road/mountain/long distance biking. Here's a blog from a 2021 bike ride I did across the US: http://blaise.bike. Here's my Strava: https://www.strava.com/athletes/9430660
